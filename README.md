**Getting Started**
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Review `firebase-init.js` and confirm the Firebase project values are correct for your deployment.
3. Update `r2-config.js` with your Cloudflare Worker URL and public R2 bucket URL.
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.
5. Start browsing or posting jobs.

**R2 + Firebase Upload Flow**
- Job media and profile photos upload to Cloudflare R2 through a Worker first.
- The public R2 URL is stored with the related job or user record.
- Firebase stays focused on lightweight application data instead of large media files.

**Cloudflare R2 Setup**
1. Create an R2 bucket in Cloudflare and enable a public bucket URL or custom domain.
2. Deploy the Worker in `cloudflare/r2-upload-worker.js` with an `R2_BUCKET` binding.
3. Copy your Worker URL and public bucket URL into `r2-config.js`.
4. Keep your Cloudflare API tokens and account secrets private and out of frontend code.

**Note**
This project still includes local/session storage behavior for some client-side flows. For production use, keep Firebase rules locked down and protect the Worker with auth or rate limits before accepting public uploads.

**Security**
This project includes security best practices:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent XSS attacks
- Input validation and sanitization for all user data
- File upload validation (type & size checks)
- MIME-type sniffing protection
- Clickjacking prevention (X-Frame-Options)
- See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) and [SECURITY-HEADERS-DEPLOYMENT.md](./SECURITY-HEADERS-DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.
